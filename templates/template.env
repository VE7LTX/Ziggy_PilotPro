# .env File for PilotPro Application
# ------------------------------
# Description:
# This file contains sensitive configuration data for the PilotPro application. It is used to store the encryption key
# required for secure data handling, particularly for user details in the SQLite database.

# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Ensure the contents of this file remain confidential and are not shared or exposed.
# 2. The ENCRYPTION_KEY stored here is essential for decrypting and encrypting user data. Keep it secure.
# 3. Do not modify or delete this file unless you are aware of its implications on the application's functionality.

# Important Note:
# Ensure this file is not pushed to version control systems to prevent exposing sensitive data.

# ENCRYPTION_KEY:
# The ENCRYPTION_KEY is a critical component for maintaining data security. It is used by the application's CryptoHandler
# to encrypt and decrypt sensitive user information stored in the database. Ensure its confidentiality.

# How to Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY:
# If you need to generate a new encryption key, use the Fernet library:
#   - Import Fernet from cryptography.fernet
#   - Use Fernet.generate_key() to generate a new key
#   - Store the generated key in this ENCRYPTION_KEY field

# Example ENCRYPTION_KEY (this is just an example and should not be used in production):
# ENCRYPTION_KEY='_db9gK0Bx0wsxgQhwHKoWs9e4RDQoqUP_NbfTfl08lE='

# Please ensure that this file is kept secure and confidential to maintain the integrity and security of the PilotPro application.



# .env file

# End of `.env` configuration for PilotPro Application.
#
# Overview:
# - The `.env` file serves as a secure storage for sensitive application configuration, primarily the ENCRYPTION_KEY.
# - This key ensures encrypted storage and secure retrieval of user data from the SQLite database.
#
# Notes for Future Maintenance:
# - Always backup this file in a secure location before making any modifications.
# - If the ENCRYPTION_KEY is ever compromised, generate a new one immediately and re-encrypt all existing data.
# - Consider using additional security layers or tools to further protect this file and its contents.
# - Periodically review the encryption methods used and update if newer, more secure methods become available.
#
# Remember: The security of the PilotPro application is heavily reliant on the integrity and confidentiality of this file. Handle with the utmost care.
