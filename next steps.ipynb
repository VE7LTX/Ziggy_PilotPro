    "Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Database Structure & Data:\n",
    "        The chat.db database contains the table chat_history with chat records.\n",
    "        Direct queries to the database work, as we were able to retrieve and decrypt messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code Inspection:\n",
    "        The ChatDatabase class (aliased as Database) in chat_db.py handles the SQLite database connection.\n",
    "        The class uses context management (__enter__ and __exit__ methods) to open and close the connection.\n",
    "        The chat_utils.py file contains the main logic for chat interactions, where the ChatDatabase class is used.\n",
    "        The Database class is instantiated within both the ContextManager and ChatUtility classes in chat_utils.py.\n",
    "        The with statement is used for context management when interacting with the database, ensuring the connection is handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Potential Issues:\n",
    "        The \"Connection is not open!\" error suggests that at some point during the application's runtime, an attempt is made to interact with the database after the connection has been closed or before it has been properly opened.\n",
    "        The application might be trying to use the database connection outside the context of the with statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options & Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thorough Error Logging:\n",
    "        What: Implement detailed logging at critical points in the application, especially around database operations.\n",
    "        Why: This will help pinpoint the exact location and cause of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enhanced Error Handling:\n",
    "        What: Add comprehensive error handling around database operations. Catch exceptions and log detailed error messages.\n",
    "        Why: This will capture unexpected issues and provide clearer insights into any underlying problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code Refactoring:\n",
    "        What: Examine and potentially refactor parts of the code to ensure optimal database connection management.\n",
    "        Why: Ensuring consistent and correct use of the database connection will prevent unexpected closures and other related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Testing in a Controlled Environment:\n",
    "        What: Replicate the issue in a test environment or a controlled scenario.\n",
    "        Why: Reproducing the issue in a controlled setting can help narrow down the exact sequence of operations leading to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Review Other Parts of the Application:\n",
    "        What: Check other parts of the code (possibly outside of the provided files) where the ChatDatabase class might be used.\n",
    "        Why: Ensuring that the ChatDatabase class is consistently used correctly throughout the application will help identify potential problem areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consultation with Database Experts:\n",
    "        What: Consider consulting with a database specialist or a team member familiar with SQLite and its intricacies.\n",
    "        Why: A fresh pair of eyes or someone with specialized knowledge might spot issues or patterns that could be causing the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "        What: Check external factors like server configurations, permissions, or other services that interact with the application.\n",
    "        Why: Sometimes, issues can arise from external configurations or interactions that aren't immediately evident from the code alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Code Reviews:\n",
    "        What: Conduct thorough code reviews with team members.\n",
    "        Why: Collaborative reviews can uncover subtle issues or areas of improvement that might have been overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this comprehensive summary, you can decide on the best course of action based on your project's priorities and constraints. Whether it's diving deeper into the code, implementing more extensive logging, or consulting with experts, each option offers a path forward to resolving the issue."

    "\n",
    "    Refactored Code:\n",
    "        Reviewed and refactored the Chat Database Management module for the PilotPro application.\n",
    "        Improved code readability, maintainability, and adherence to NASA's programming standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Logging Enhancements:\n",
    "        Added granular logging to all database-related operations to aid in debugging and traceability.\n",
    "        Used logging levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and EXCEPTION to categorize log messages appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Error Handling:\n",
    "        Improved error handling mechanisms to catch and handle specific exceptions like sqlite3 errors separately from general exceptions.\n",
    "        Provided clear error messages and included error recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Function Improvements:\n",
    "        Enhanced the open_connection and insert_message functions of the ChatDatabase class for better error handling and logging.\n",
